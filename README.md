# SNHU-CS-350

## Project Summary
This project involved building a thermostat using a raspberry PI, temperature sensor, LEDs, and an LCD display. It used in three states (Off, Heating, Cooling) and users could to adjust the set temperature using  3 buttons. buttons. The system managed transitions with a state machine and logged data via UART and the display.

## Strengths in the Project
I successfully implemented a structured state machine. The integration of the temperature sensor via I2C and handling button inputs for user control worked well. The code was modular and easy to maintain.

## Areas for Improvement
I probably could have added more error handling in case something went wrong. 

## Tools and Resources Used
GitHub for version control and documentation.
Draw.io for the state machine diagram.
VS Code for the coding.
Mobaxterm for the ssh connection management.

## Transferable Skills
This project strengthened my skills in state machine logic, hardware integration, and structured programming. These skills are useful for future embedded systems and IoT projects.

## Maintaining Readability and Adaptability
I kept the code modular with clear comments and structured logic.
